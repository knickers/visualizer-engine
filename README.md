# Reciprocating Kinetic Extruder Visualizer Engine

Kinetic visualizer pistons for a more discernibly dynamic extruder, inspired by extruder visualizers from other designers. Reciprocating Engine built to attach to your direct dive extruder motor. Can also attach to any motor which has screw holes in the corners.

The engine block is held in place by circular tabs that press fit into the screw holes of standard NEMA 17 stepper motors. The fit should be tight so the assembly holds itself in place securely. If the mounting tabs don't fit in your motor, edit the tab size in Thingiverse Customizer.

The crankshaft requires a neodymium magnet to hold itself to the stepper motor shaft, **8 mm** diameter by **3 mm** tall.

Added different cylinder configurations and a configurable propeller. These are not provided as pre-rendered STLs, make them in customizer. Choose these different cylinder numbers and angles:

* Single Cylinder
* V-Twin
* Flat Twin
* W Three
* Radial Four
* Clockwise or Counter Clockwise propeller
* 1-8 propeller blades

*Edit: May 8th 2020*
Added Thingiverse Customizer ability! Easily customize the engine to fit your motor right here in Thingiverse.

*Edit: Feb 16th 2020*
Added more versions with tighter tolerances. The original engine was rendered with 0.5 mm tolerances. Now choose between 0.5 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.2 mm and 0.1 mm tolerance. If you are unsure which one to choose, start with the 0.3 mm tolerance version.

Originally, this model was designed in OpenJSCAD. The `v-twin.jscad` file is now out of date and doesn't contain the new features of `engine.scad`. To customize the OpenJSCAD engine, load `v-twin.jscad` into the https://openjscad.org website and edit the parameters. Then choose an export format and click *Generate*, After that completes, click *Download*.

3 perimeters for connecting rods and engine block so they are solid.

I tried to make my pistons as light as possible:

* 0 infill
* 1 bottom layer
* 2 top layers
